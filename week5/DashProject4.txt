The flash wont runt on this for some reason. The actual page where it says "you're done!" Didn't give me the option to generate a personal link to my complete page. I have no idea why. 

Here's another link. Not sure if it's helpful at all, but I included 2 photos to show that the laser eyes are actually flashing and that the guy is dancing. All buttons work. Sorry if this isn't helpful at all.
