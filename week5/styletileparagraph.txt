Personally I prefer full style tiles to comps, but both ways seem to work well in order to organize and create an image of how the wesite needs to turn out. I really like to visually create the images in photoshop, it really helps me to know what kind of code I need to write in order to make the photoshopped site a reality. The tiles are nice because it's a piece by piece build instead of looking at the whole site at one time I can focus on the smaller slices.
