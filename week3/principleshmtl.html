The University of Pennsylvania's website is a great example of mapping. The controls are easy to find, do exactly what they say they will do, and their search bar makes it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. The site is also mapped to change with the screen size or device being used. Making the navigation functional no matter what.

The Rolling Stone website is an excellent example of Rule of Thirds. The content on their homepage is placed along the 9 squares of thirds on the page. This makes the page appealing to the eyes and also makes it easy to view information and images without being overwhelmed.

Michigan State University's student info webpage is not only an example of the Rule of Thirds principle, but also showcases the Chunking principle as well. Information is briefly described in chunks, or small paragraphs, which can then be clicked on and looked at in more detail and longer explanations. This makes it easy for the user to find exactly what they are looking for without wasting time reading through a lot of unnecessary text.

One website sticking to Hick's Law very well is topshop. Their menu makes it easy to find their items quickly and easily, even though there are many options. The menu is broken down into categories which can then be used to navigate to more specific items, simplifying the amount of decisions the user needs to make. This type of navigation menu makes it easy and quick to find what the shoppers need.

I think that Apple is doing a really good, and very simple, job at showing how affordances can really make or break a website. Overdoing it can be overkill to users. Big, bulky obnoxious buttons are not appealing to most and sticking with a simple design has helped Apple have one of the most successful websites in the world. Their buttons are the icons of the products they sell and subtle changes in color, shade, or boldness let users know what icon is clocked, has been clicked, or which one they are going to click-the hover. I think the simplicity proves that you don't have to include buttons with 3D aspects, or weird colors, to make people aware that they are there.
